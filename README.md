# example-data-process

This repo is used to preprocess the csv data of the following simulaitor including ComplexSocialOpinion (SocialArray), Group-Social-Force and CrowdEgress.  

Tkinter are required to run GUI, and matplotlib and pandas are optionally required for further data processing and visualization. 

So if you are interested in this project and would like to contribute your ideas, please feel free to start an issue to propose your ideas!  Collaborations are much welcome and comments are appreciated!  There are several things to do to improve the source code and document.  For example, the user interface (GUI) is to be systematically tested and improved, but I do not have much time to do that.  If you are good at developing user interface, please feel free to contribute and I will give you credits in the manual or in our papers.
